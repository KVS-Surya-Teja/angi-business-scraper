## Message
When the `ui.py` is run, the user's input is taken from the HTML UI deployed by Flask, which retrieves it and stores it as variables. You can see it in `app.py` (Currently Incomplete). These inputs are used to create the most suitable URL from the Angi's site which matches with the user's input. You can see it in `new_options.py` (Done as a python demo, couldn't integrate it with Flask yet). The `options.py` contains the lists of all categories, states and cities within those states (Completed). 

I tried my best to deploy the `app.py` and scrape using bs4 and requests in `main.py` but currently I faced some issues like warning that it is a development server and runtime error respectively.

This project is done with the best of my efforts and my novice programming experience sir. 

Thank you for giving me my first webscraping project sir,
